3652,This is the primary fill of beam slot/drip gully. It is more likely to be the latter as it looks deliberately deposited within this linear cut to facilitate drainage whilst overlain by silty material which could be the run-off from a sloping roof. The deposit shallows and peters out on it's east end after it turns southward c. 120 degrees. Beam slot theory is also arguable as this gravel could be the packing around the beam as drainage to prevent rotting which is also necessary.
