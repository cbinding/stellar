		<rdfs:comment>English Heritage extensions to CIDOC CRM expressed in RDF, for the archaeology domain. Naming and numbering; identifiers UIDs assigned according to the following scheme:
EHE0xxx – objects and places, concepts representing real-world entities
EHE1xxx – events in the past
EHE2xxx – events in the present
UIDs have been assigned initially using an alphabetised list of entities. Where additional entities have been inserted into the model, they have been assigned UIDs from the end of the appropriate numbering sequence with existing UIDs retained: No renumbering of existing entities should occur. To this end, the number allocation blocks comprise 999 UIDs in each sequence to allow room for expansion.
Naming convention follows broadly OO principles in that names are formed according to the relationships an object participates in. Core entities are named using natural language names that are easily understood eg Group, Context or Find. Associated entities are then named accordingly. For example, if we take a Group, an event relating to this group would be referred to as a GroupEvent. The record of such an event taking place would be a GroupEventRecord and an associated note would be referred to as a GroupEventRecordNote. If this note was classified by type the classification would be a GroupEventRecordNoteType. Similarly, if we take a Find (referred to as a ContextFind in the model in order to reinforce the idea that all finds originate from a context, even if the context is unknown), then we can see that it was produced as part of a ContextFindProductionEvent which took place at a ContextFindProductionEventLocation.

		<rdfs:comment>The concept of survey is here used to describe activities which involve going to a location and gathering some data.

		<rdfs:comment>As noted (EHE0097), some finds do not end up being used in the way that their makers might have intended. It is sometimes necessary therefore to distinguish the original intended use for which something was made, from the general use that it ended up having. (e.g. quite often pieces of sculpture get reused as building material in later walls, once the significance of them as art or religious works goes out of fashion)</rdfs:comment>

		<rdfs:label>Context Find</rdfs:label>
		<rdfs:comment>Finds are obviously physical objects; it may be that a particular find can be described in more detail as a man-made object, but not all finds are man-made hence the link to the more generic entity. The distinction between bulk finds and small finds present in the recording system does not appear to relate to the nature of finds themselves, rather to the practicalities of recording large numbers of objects hence, at this point, no distinction is made between bulk and small finds other than bulk finds have less information about them recorded</rdfs:comment>

Provides a means to relate projects carried out at a particular site, even where the interventions or survey work have not been at the same spatial location.

We can reason about the sequence in which context formation events took place and build a stratigraphic understanding of the site.

It is regarded to exist as long as it preserves at least partially the geometric arrangement of particles it had at excavation time.

		<rdfs:label>Area of Investigation</rdfs:label>
		<rdfs:comment>Effectively, the extent of the archaeological site as defined by the current project. The word Site is not used here to avoid confusion with the CRM concept of Site. In this case, we are meaning the area under investigation as opposed to an instance of E27 Site or a site as defined in the SMR or NMR or other data source. The CRM concept of Site denotes the material constellations and may be subject to change due to excavation activity and physical phenomena. It should not be confused with the mere geographic extent of the site that does not change.  This entity is not present in the recording system, but is necessary so we can reason about the place, the actual patch of land, being investigated</rdfs:comment>

		<rdfs:comment>The construction of a sequence of development is effectively the process of phasing. Based upon the sequence of context formation (i.e. stratigraphic sequence), any finds (i.e. spot dating) and any other pertinent information, sub-groups and groups (and further levels of group as required) are used to develop a sequence of landscape events for the excavation. This sequence of landscape events is effectively the phased chronology for the site based on available evidence </rdfs:comment>

In some cases one Small Find number is given to a group of pieces from one context, e.g. nails, window and vessel glass, but this is only done with prior agreement. General Bulk finds (e.g. pottery and animal bone), which tend to be processed and analysed in groups, are bagged and labelled with the context number that they come from, but not given individual UID finds numbers</rdfs:comment>

		<rdfs:comment>The process of grouping draws together the stuff found in multiple contexts according to some commonality of observed properties. As such, by grouping together a collection of post-hole cuts to form a sub-group witnessing the creation of a post-built structure, we are defining a new feature that represents said structure. The grouped Context Stuff may only be a part of the overall structure the Group is intended to represent. As such, it may cover even a larger space than the constituent contexts (e.g. in some unexcavated areas)</rdfs:comment>
