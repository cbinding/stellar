Update (28/10/2016):
See also STELETO (http://github.com/cbinding/STELETO) - a newer simple template-based conversion application based
on a subset of the original STELLAR source code. It runs cross platform - tested on Windows and Linux (using mono).
We used this application for some large data conversion operations in the context of the ARIADNE FP7 project
