"SF",2348,"D","Base of a grey-ware ?jar with the junction between wall and base trimmed to a fairly consistent height.  The use of pottery counters is far from certain, particularly when they are, like this one, much larger than bone or glass board-game counters. Various ideas have been put forward (Crummy 1983, 93-4):  a) tally counters - a relief from Trier supports this idea as it shows a man moving discs on a tray, interpreted as counters on a reckoning board (MacGregor 1978, 33; Chardron-Picault 2004, figs 15-16); b) mats for hot pots (very large and thick ones made from tile or dolium sherds are ideal for this purpose); c) lids for narrow-mouthed jars - a few examples have been found in situ (H. Major, pers. comm); d) counters for a game comparable to merrels played on 'boards' scratched in the earth; e) a set with the pieces graded in diameter found in Colchester has been identified as a child's stacking toy (Colchester Archaeologist 11, 34); f) work in France has noted that they are often concentrated on sanctuary sites and in urban workshop zones, raising the possibility that they were produced as a secondary product by artisans who sold them to worshippers for use as votive offerings (Tuffreau-Libre 1994, 128-37; Chardron-Picault 2004, 335-7); g) some, of course, were pierced and used as spindlewhorls - Roman sherds were often selected for this purpose in the Migration Period; roughly-shaped counters may therefore be unfinished spindlewhorls.  Given the diversity in size and finish of the counters, and the diversity in their archaeological context and associations, it seems most likely that different sizes, with different degrees of finish, were used in different ways. Their inclusion under the Keyword 'Recreation' is therefore a matter of convenience, rather than accurate identification of function. [N Crummy, 11/03/06]  References P.

The sherd was analysed using XRF (x-ray fluoresence) for the presence of copper, tin, lead and other alloying agents such as zinc. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDAX) determined that none of these elements were present, with no characteristic peak at 8.0 Kev visible for copper. The peaks visible are those for iron Ka at 6.4 Kev, iron Kb at 7.06 Kev, the peak at just over 3 KEV, which is probably calcium, and the peak at 16 Kev which is from the equipment's screen.

"SF",4077,"C","COLEM: C050937. Date in: 21-09-05. Date finished: 03-02-06. Condition: Deteriorated. Encrusted with amorphous layer of soft corrosion and ingrained gritty soil. This has already&nbsp; been abraded from the convex side, exposing underlying surface. This has remains of a dark green patina but is disrupted by more bulky corrosion and surface loss, which has exposed cuprite and other pale powdery corrosion, some active. Other side is more intact and has a largely intact patina and some discernible detail. Treatment: Removed&nbsp;corrosion/soil - small handtools. Degreased - acetone. Stabilised - BTA, 3% in IMS under vacuum. Rinsed - IMS. Dried - air. Lacquered - Incralac, 50% in toluene."
